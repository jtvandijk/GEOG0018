## Welcome {.unnumbered}
Welcome to the second half of **Methods in Human Geography**. In this part of the module, you will delve into essential statistical analysis techniques and gain a basic foundation in creating thematic maps. We will be using R and the RStudio environment for statistical analysis, and the open-source programme QGIS for handling spatial data.
